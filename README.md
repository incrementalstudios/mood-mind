## ðŸ§ª Depression Detection Logic

1. Users speak responses to a set of system-generated prompts.
2. Responses are transcribed to text via SpeechRecognition API.
3. The transcribed text is analyzed using sentiment analysis.
4. The system calculates a score and suggests next steps if depression is detected.

### Sample Output

Example input:
> Saya merasa kosong dan hampa

Sentiment result:
```json
{
  "score": -5,
  "comparative": -1.25,
  "words": ["merasa", "kosong", "hampa"],
  "positive": [],
  "negative": ["merasa", "kosong", "hampa"]
}
```
